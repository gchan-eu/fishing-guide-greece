# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository is a comprehensive fishing guide for Greece, focused on the region of Agios Konstantinos Fthiotida. All content is in Greek and organized as Markdown documents. There is no code, build system, or automated tests—this is a documentation-only project.

## File Structure & Key Documents
- Main guide: `fishing-guide.md`
- Fish species: `fish-species.md`
- Seasonal calendar: `seasonal-calendar.md`
- Regulations: `regulations.md`
- Equipment guide: `equipment-guide.md`
- Technique guides: `surf-casting.md`, `spinning.md`, `bolognese.md`, `rock-fishing.md`, `float-fishing.md`, `apiko.md`
- Project info: `README.md` (in Greek)
- License: `LICENSE`

## Conventions & Patterns
- All documents are written in Greek and use Markdown formatting.
- Each guide is self-contained and covers a specific aspect of fishing in the region.
- Cross-references between guides use relative Markdown links (e.g., `[Οδηγός Ψαρέματος](fishing-guide.md)`).
- No code, scripts, or automation are present—focus is on content accuracy and structure.
- Updates should preserve Greek language and local context.

## Contribution Workflow
- Contributions are made by editing Markdown files directly.
- Open an issue or pull request for new information, corrections, or improvements.
- No build, test, or CI/CD steps are required.
- Follow the structure and style of existing guides for consistency.

## Examples
- To add a new fishing technique, create a new `.md` file and link it from `README.md` and/or `fishing-guide.md`.
- To update regulations, edit `regulations.md` and ensure cross-references are updated.

## External Dependencies
- None. All content is local and static.

## Special Notes
- Respect the Greek language and local fishing context in all edits.
- Do not introduce code, scripts, or automation unless the project scope changes.
- Use clear section headings and bullet points for readability.
